Here are the key insights that change everything:
Linux NPU Driver Support is Robust:

Intel NPU drivers work great on Linux with Level Zero API
AMD XDNA drivers support NPU access on AMD processors
RISC-V systems can run NPU-enabled applications through emerging AI acceleration solutions
All NPUs are accessible through standard Linux device interfaces (/dev/accel/accel0, etc.)

Proven Software Architectures Exist:

OpenVINO Model Server can expose Intel NPUs via gRPC/REST APIs
llama.cpp RPC architecture enables distributed inference with rpc-server workers
LocalAI's P2P federated mode provides automatic discovery and load balancing
Custom gRPC services offer maximum flexibility for your specific needs

Your Architecture is Highly Feasible:

Each machine runs a Linux NPU service daemon exposing the local NPU
Master system acts as coordinator/load balancer over WiFi-7
Cross-architecture communication works through standardized APIs
No special hardware needed - just applications accessing NPU device files

Recommended Implementation Path:

Start with OpenVINO Model Server for Intel NPUs
Create custom gRPC services for AMD/RISC-V NPUs
Implement master coordinator with service discovery
Add load balancing and fault tolerance
Optimize for WiFi-7 performance

This is a much more practical approach than trying to access NPUs remotely at the hardware level. You're essentially building a distributed AI inference cluster using proven software patterns!

Compilation Instructions
For C++ Client:
bash# Basic client
g++ -o hailo_client hailo_npu_client.cpp -pthread

# SDL2 client
g++ -o hailo_sdl2_client hailo_sdl2_client.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -pthread
For Python Client:
bash# Install dependencies
pip install pillow numpy

# Make executable
chmod +x hailo_client.py
Usage Examples
C++ Client:
bash# Run inference on an image
./hailo_client 192.168.1.100 input_image.jpg output_results.bin

# SDL2 interactive client
./hailo_sdl2_client 192.168.1.100 initial_image.jpg
Python Client:
bash# Basic inference
python3 hailo_client.py 192.168.1.100 input_image.jpg

# With benchmark
python3 hailo_client.py 192.168.1.100 input_image.jpg --benchmark --iterations 20

# Custom image size
python3 hailo_client.py 192.168.1.100 input_image.jpg --image-size 416 416

# Raw data input
python3 hailo_client.py 192.168.1.100 input_data.bin --raw-data
Key Features:

Multiple Format Support - Images, raw binary data
Benchmarking - Performance testing with statistics
Error Handling - Connection testing and graceful failures
SDL2 Integration - Interactive image loading and display
Async Processing - Non-blocking inference calls
Drag & Drop - Easy image loading in SDL2 version

The clients handle all the networking details and provide both command-line and interactive interfaces for working with your remote Hailo NPU. Which approach would you like to start with?
